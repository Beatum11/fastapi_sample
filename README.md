This is a basic FastAPI sample that I plan to use as a foundation for more complex projects. 
In this example, I've conceptualized an API for a simple blog, using features like authentication and authorization, also using PostgreSQL and Redis for data management. 
Additionally, I plan to consistently use Docker and GitHub Actions for efficient deployment and workflow automation.
